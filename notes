Main focus: remote desktop
- SLE as connecting to other systems:

Remote Desktop Methods
	explain that XDMCP is something of the past, not a good idea to use it these days (security and bandwith reason)
	VNC - Xvnc. configured from YasT2
		/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-libvnc.conf - don't use the suggested DefaultDepth 16. bsc#942982
			not supported by lots of driver/hardware combos - leave user with an Xserver that won't start
			no real benefit.
		managed with vncconfig, vncpasswd
			how does that interact with loginctl
	VNC - vino. configured from control-center. what gconf keys
	xrdp
Demo
	demo connecting to SLES 12 through : VNC, RDP (with a Windows client),
	VNC remote connection from java in a browser or even HTML5 in a browser !!
Other Methods
	remote X11 applications through ssh is still supported and secure :
		ssh -X vs ssh -Y
		why does ssh -X and then evince not resize.
		problems with menu bar - ie ssh -> gnote. Can't click on the menu bar in the header
	starting graphical applications in containers (see with Cedric)
	should we demo what alexl demoed during xdg-app talk on how to do anything across X11 socket ?
Session monitoring / management
	session management (kill a session, see man systemd-logind) with systemd-loginctl
	debugging
		/etc/gdm/custom.conf -> section [debug] -> Enable=true

TLS support for VNC : done in vino/vinagre, should be done for SP1 for
tigervnc (to be checked)
 

* demo of kiosk: 
- explain gsettings / dconf defaults + lockdown: disabling Alt-F2 and
preventing any other keybinding to be set on this particular action
- explanation of polkit permissions and demo on one specific permission:
disabling USB stick mount without root password



Setup, usage and best practices for optimizing remote graphical access to your SUSE Linux Enterprise systems.
This session will cover the various remote access and multiple user strategies and options available.
How to securely setup and in what situations to use the various remote graphical access methods such as vnc, xdmcp, VM access, freerdp and others.
Launching X applications in containers.
What is required and best solutions for accessing SUSE Linux Enterprise graphical applications from Windows.
Situations that will require fallback to alternate display and window managers.
Performance considerations and limitations with multiple simultaneous graphical user sessions and multiple user switching.
Monitoring and administrating sessions.

How to monitor via systemd loginctl
Add more logging to gdm/gnome-shell on failure - possible backtrace from who called the oh-no method
On black screen we still have gnome-shell running, we just don't have mutter anymore – display a warning screen.
Add tls support in tigervnc so can talk with vino
how do we configure vino/vinagre – what gconf keys.
xrdp – bnc939109, bnc928030
vnc/vino/vinagre,tigervnc,yast(xinetd)
xdmcp, xrdp, vm access, xrdp
when you will need to use xdm/iceWM (see the readme)
windows access - attachmate java solution (Bankim Shaw), (is this reflectionX ?) Xming, Exceed (bad), cygwin, vncviewer,
	tigervnc also provides a java version of the viewer - we use this from the browser
	this java applet can also be run standalone
		shell script started from xinetd and prints out simple http response
launching X apps in containers
/etc/sysconfig/displaymanager how it works, multiuser bnc#909360, switching users,
vnc
       	started by yast
        the viewer displays a black screen when X.Org is run with libvnc.so and gets vt-switched away. Either close the remote connection or displaying a notification screen would be better
	vino and vinagre support tls, we don't support this with Xvnc and vncviewer but it seems capable

SLED Kiosk - liibreoffice, samba, gdm with AD Login, snapper, empathy with local users
how to optimize the best choice of window managers and display managers, optimize for number of users, use the term systemd for administring,
