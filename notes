Setup and optimization for remote graphical access

Remote Desktop Methods
	explain that XDMCP is something of the past, not a good idea to use it these days (security and bandwith reason)
	VNC - Xvnc. configured from YasT2 (xinetd)
		/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-libvnc.conf - don't use the suggested DefaultDepth 16. bsc#942982
			not supported by lots of driver/hardware combos - leave user with an Xserver that won't start
			no real benefit.
		managed with vncconfig, vncpasswd
			how does that interact with loginctl
		bnc#920969
	VNC - vino. configured from control-center. what gconf keys
	RDP (provided by xrdp / freerdp) – bnc939109, bnc928030
	Vinagre - discuss keybinding passthrough, show full screen toolbar now that it works, gconf keys
	vncviewer
		tigervnc also provides a java version of the viewer - we use this from the browser
		this java applet can also be run standalone
			shell script started from xinetd and prints out simple http response
	Security - TLS support for VNC in vino/vinagre. Supposed to be in SP1 for tigervnc also but as of RC1 does not work
Demo
	demo connecting to SLES 12 through : VNC, RDP (with a Windows client),
	VNC remote connection from java in a browser or even HTML5 in a browser !!
Other Methods
	remote X11 applications through ssh is still supported and secure :
		ssh -X vs ssh -Y
		why does ssh -X and then evince not resize.
		problems with menu bar - ie ssh -> gnote. Can't click on the menu bar in the header
	starting graphical applications in containers (see with Cedric)
	should we demo what alexl demoed during xdg-app talk on how to do anything across X11 socket ?
Accessing SLE from windows
		windows access - attachmate java solution (Bankim Shaw), (is this reflectionX ?) Xming, Exceed (bad), cygwin, vncviewer,
Session monitoring / management
	session management (kill a session, see man systemd-logind) with systemd-loginctl
	debugging
		/etc/gdm/custom.conf -> section [debug] -> Enable=true
	when you will need to use xdm/iceWM (see the readme)
	/etc/sysconfig/displaymanager how it works
	Performance considerations and limitations with multiple simultaneous graphical user sessions and multiple user switching.
		multiuser bnc#909360, switching users,
Additional settings
	demo of kiosk: 
		- explain gsettings / dconf defaults + lockdown: disabling Alt-F2 and
		preventing any other keybinding to be set on this particular action
		- explanation of polkit permissions and demo on one specific permission:
			disabling USB stick mount without root password


Add more logging to gdm/gnome-shell on failure - possible backtrace from who called the oh-no method
On black screen we still have gnome-shell running, we just don't have mutter anymore – display a warning screen.
the viewer displays a black screen when X.Org is run with libvnc.so and gets vt-switched away. Either close the remote connection or displaying a notification screen would be better
